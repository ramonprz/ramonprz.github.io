Hi there! I'm Ramon, a freelance data data professional, researcher and educator traveling and working remotely since late 2021. 



My latest full-time role was a Senior Product Developer at Decoded, where I created custom data science tools, workshops, and training programs for clients in industries ranging from retail to finance. I still teach workshops for Decoded although in a more ad-hoc scheduly (between 5-10 per month).

My previous roles have been at the intersection of education, data science, and research in the areas of entrepreneurship and strategy, alongside a few research ventures in consumer behaviour and development economics in industry and academia, respectively.

During my professional career, I've had the fortune of working with research teams dedicated to helping multinational companies understand their customers better via data-driven approaches ranging from A/B testing to machine learning. I also enjoy giving workshops and have had the honour of participating in PyCon (US, APAC, and Chile), SciPy (US and Japan), and countless Meetup events. In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, playing baseball, and exploring many of the outdoor wonders Australia has to offer.
