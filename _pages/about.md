Hi there! Ramon here from the DR 🇩🇴 I currently work at [Seldon](seldon.io) in London leading our 
Developer Relations efforts.

I'm an educator at heart on all things science, technology, and (as of recently) design.

I have a lot of breath with different technologies that cover the entire data and machine 
learning lifecycle, and a lot of depth in technology education.

That said, I'm no native to any kind of technology or skill, but I'm still able to speak a few well 
with a noticeable accent. My goal when I pick up a new challenge or project is to get it done 
in a unique and yet efficient way while explaining what I did in clearest way possible.


A bit more detail on my experience.

Although I'm no distributed computing expert, I've work on research engineering projects where I've 
(managed to) successfully set up compute clusters (🖥+🖥+🖥) using different cloud technologies (☁️⛈☁️) without 
breaking our AWS bar tab (🍻). The goal of the project was to clean and analyze large amounts of data using 
frameworks like Dask, PySpark and Ray (not together), and then train --what I would have considered then-- large 
language models.

I've also done some cool data engineering work. I created a straightforward data platform using only AWS services
to move, reshape, clean, and make use of all the data of my employer. Although this project was never continued 
or picked up by another engineer upon my departure, I learned a ton about data quality, infrastructure and how to (or try to avoid) technical debt.

On the software dev side (👨‍💻), I've built several microservices and web apps, with and without machine learning, to help translate, summarize, and improve educational content. I've written infrastructure as code scripts (with a lot of headaches along the way) to set up a Jupyter Hub instance in GKE and teach different data science classes at different events 
around Australia.

You might find the content (📚) I've developed over the years interesting so head over that way 
and let me know if you find any of it useful. :)
