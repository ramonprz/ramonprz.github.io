Hi there! I'm Ramon here from the DR 🇩🇴

I'm an educator at heart on all things science, technology, and (as of recently) design, among other things. 

I have a lot of breath with different technologies that cover the entire data and machine 
learning lifecycle, and a lot of depth in technology education.

On the engineering side, I'm no distributed computing expert but I've managed to set up compute clusters 
(🖥+🖥+🖥) using different cloud technologies (☁️⛈☁️) to clean and analyze large amounts of data using 
frameworks like Dask, PySpark and Ray (not together). If you've never heard of these, they are Python tools.

I'm no wizard (🧙🏽‍♂️) of data engineering but I've used AWS and a few Open Source tools to build a fully 
functioning data platform for my former employer.

On the software dev side (👨‍💻) I've built several model-driven APIs using different ML frameworks and FastAPI.

I am no DevOps engineer but I've written infrastructure as code scripts (with a lot of headaches along the 
way) to set up a Jupyter Hub instance in GKE and teach data visualization at a MeetUp event with over 200 
participants in Sydney.

That said, I'm no native to any kind of technology or skill, but I'm quite fluent at some, although with a 
noticeable accent, of course. My goal when I pick up a new challenge is to get the job done and explain my 
work in the clearest and most concise way possible.

My depth, on the other hand, belongs to research (🕵🏼‍♂️) and education (📝), which are the two fields 
I've been at the intersection of for most of my career. These two have given me analytical rigor, 
attention to detail, and the ability to distill topics and projects to colleagues, clients, and 
different audiences alike.

My latest gig was teaching a data science course from October 2022 to January 2023 for IBM and 
SkillUp Online. My last full-time gig was as a Senior Product Developer for [Decoded](decoded.com), 
where I created custom data science tools, workshops, and training programs for clients in industries 
ranging from retail to finance. I still teach workshops for Decoded although in a more ad-hoc way. I 
also initiated the development of Decoded's data platform, a cloud-native solution in AWS that addresses 
the data needs of the company and allows data consumers to access clean data to their hearts content.

My previous roles before Decoded have all been at the intersection of education, data science, and 
research in the areas of entrepreneurship and strategy, alongside a few research ventures in consumer 
behaviour and development economics in industry and academia, respectively.

During my professional career, I've had the fortune of working with research teams dedicated to helping 
multinational companies understand their customers better via data-driven approaches ranging from A/B 
testing to machine learning.

On the personal side, I enjoy giving technical workshops and have had the honour of participating in 
PyCon (US, APAC, Ireland and Chile), SciPy (US and Japan), PyData Global, and countless Meetup events. 
In my spare time, I enjoy mountain biking, playing baseball, and exploring many of the outdoor wonders 
Australia has to offer.

You might find the content (📚) I've developed over the years interesting so head over that way 
and let me know if you find any of it useful. :)
