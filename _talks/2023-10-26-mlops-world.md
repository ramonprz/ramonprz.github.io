## Abstract

There are many recipes to serve machine learning models to end users today, and even 
though new ways keep popping up as time passes, some questions remain: How do we pick 
the appropriate serving recipe from the menu we have available, and how do can we execute 
it as fast and efficiently as possible? In this short talk, we’re going to go through a 
whirlwind tour of the different machine learning deployment strategies available today, 
and we’ll also touch on a few do’s and don’ts while we’re at it. This session will be 
jargonless but not buzzwordy- or meme-less.
