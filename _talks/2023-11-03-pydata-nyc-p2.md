## Abstract

From music composition with code to style transfer and music generation with machine learning 
(ML), the intersection of music, programming, and ML is opening up exciting avenues for 
innovation and creativity. This session will take you through a whirlwind tour of the latest 
techniques and applications that use code and ML to compose music, generate novel rhythms, and 
evolve the way we approach audio production. If you want to get started writing code and algorithms 
that create or enhance music, this session will give you the right tools to begin your journey 
and continue learning.
