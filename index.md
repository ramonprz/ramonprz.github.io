Hi there! 👋 I'm Ramon, a data professional living in Sydney, and here's a bit more about me.

I have a lot of breath with different technologies that cover the entire data and machine 
learning lifecycle, and a lot of depth in technology education.

I'm no distributed computing expert but I've managed to set up compute clusters (🖥+🖥+🖥) using different cloud technologies (☁️⛈☁️) to clean and analyze large amounts of data using Dask, Spark and Ray (not together).

I'm no wizard (🧙🏽‍♂️) of data engineering but I've used AWS and a few Open Source tools to build a fully functioning data platform for one of my employers.

I'm no software engineer (👨‍💻) and yet I've built several model-driven APIs using different ML frameworks and FastAPI.

I am no DevOps engineer but I've written infrastructure as code scripts (with a lot of headaches along the 
way) to set up a Jupyter Hub instance in GKE and teach data visualization at a MeetUp event with over 200 participants in Sydney.

That said, even though I am not a native to any of the above skills, I can still speak all of them 
and a few more, fluently but with a noticeable accent. My goal when picking up a new challenge is to 
get the job done and explain my work in the clearest and most concise way possible.

My depth, on the other hand, belongs to research (🕵🏼‍♂️) and education (📝), which are the two fields 
I've been at the intersection of for most of my career. These two have given me analytical rigor, 
attention to detail, and the ability to distill topics and projects to colleagues, clients, and 
different audiences alike.

You might find the content (📚) I've developed over the years interesting so head over that way 
and let me know if you find any of it useful. :)
