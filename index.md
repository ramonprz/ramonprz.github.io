Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ramon, a data professional living in Sydney.

Here's a bit about me. I have a lot of breath with different technologies that cover the entire machine 
learning lifecycle. 

I'm no distributed computing expert but I've managed to set up compute clusters using different cloud technologies to clean and analyze large chunks of data using Dask, Spark and Ray (not together).

I'm no wizard of data engineering but I've used Prefect and AWS to set up a fully functioning data engineering platform for one of my employers.

I'm no software engineer and yet I've built several model-driven APIs using different ML frameworks and FastAPI.

I am no DevOps person but I've set up a Jupyter Hub instance in GKE to teach data visualization at a MeetUp event with over 200 participants in Sydney.

That said, even though I am not native to any of the above skills, I can still speak all of them, and a few more, fluently but with a noticeable accent. You can bet I'll do everything I can to get the message across in the clearest and most concise way possible.

My depth, on the other hand, belongs to research and education, which are the two fields I've been at 
the intersection of for most of my career. These two have given me analytical rigor, attention to 
detail, and the ability to distill topics and projects to colleagues, clients, and different audiences alike.

You might find the content I've developed over the years interesting so head over that way and let me know if you find any of it useful. :)
