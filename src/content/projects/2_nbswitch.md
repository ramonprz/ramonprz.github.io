NbSwitch is one of the core components of [Inventor](./1_inventor). When you donwload an interactive lesson from our catalog, GitHub, Kaggle or anywhere else, NbSwitch will allow you to switch the context, format, and language of that notebook on the fly.

For the best quality output, I recommend that you use SOTA LLMs like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and the latest version of Gemini by Google. OSS models will perform well but the quality is slightly higher with the SOTA ones.
