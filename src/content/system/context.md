## About Me
[Add your bio and background information here]


Hi there! Ramon here from the DR 🇩🇴 I was recently working at [Seldon](seldon.io) in London leading their 
Developer Relations efforts. I am currently freelancing and working on a few personal projects, mainly, [Inventor](inventor.dev).

I'm an educator at heart on all things science, technology, and (as of recently) design.

I have a lot of breath with different technologies that cover the entire data and machine 
learning lifecycle, and a lot of depth in technology education.

That said, I'm no native to any kind of technology or skill, but I'm still able to speak a few well 
with a noticeable accent. My goal when I pick up a new challenge or project is to get it done 
in a unique and yet efficient way while explaining what I did in clearest way possible.


A bit more detail on my experience.

Although I'm no distributed computing expert, I've work on research engineering projects where I've 
(managed to) successfully set up compute clusters (🖥+🖥+🖥) using different cloud technologies (☁️⛈☁️) without 
breaking our AWS bar tab (🍻). The goal of the project was to clean and analyze large amounts of data using 
frameworks like Dask, PySpark and Ray (not together), and then train --what I would have considered then-- large 
language models.

I've also done some cool data engineering work. I created a straightforward data platform using only AWS services
to move, reshape, clean, and make use of all the data of my employer. Although this project was never continued 
or picked up by another engineer upon my departure, I learned a ton about data quality, infrastructure and 
how to (or try to avoid) technical debt.

On the software dev side (👨‍💻), I've built several microservices and web apps, with and without machine 
learning, to help translate, summarize, and improve educational content. I've written infrastructure as 
code scripts (with a lot of headaches along the way) to set up a Jupyter Hub instance in GKE and teach 
different data science classes at different events 
around Australia.

You might find the content (📚) I've developed over the years interesting so head over that way 
and let me know if you find any of it useful. :)

**LinkedIn Bio**
Hi there! I’ve been working with data for about 9 years and part of that has been doing data analysis, and another part has been building data products that include dashboards, a data platform, and quite a few machine learning models. What I enjoyed the most, though, is all the content and teaching I’ve been fortunate enough to do over the years at/for universities, companies, conferences, and MeetUp events.

On the personal side, I try to spend as much time as possible mountain biking, being outdoors, or finding new places to eat or drink coffee at.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you are a data professional or someone interested in data analytics, science, research, or anything along those lines. If we’ve never met before, please send me a note with your “let’s connect” request.


## Projects

### NBSwitch
NbSwitch is an open source tool that let's change the use case, language, and format (top-down to bottom-up) 
of a jupyter notebook using State of the Art closed- and open-source models.

### Qdrant
I did a short contract with Qdrant to help them with all things related to Developer Relations. While there, I
helped with their documentation and tutorials, created videos and spoke at a few events on their behalf.


## Skills & Technologies

Ramon is a data scientist and educator with a passion for teaching and learning. He has a diverse set of skills and experiences that span across data science, machine learning, software development, and education. His main tools are Python, R, SQL, AWS, and, more recently, Tauri alongside SolidJS.

## Experience

### Seldon

Developer Relations Engineer

Actively contributed to Seldon's suite of dev tools with emphasis on the paid machine learning inference products, crafted educational content for the OSS tools, delivered talks at conferences on different ML topics, and engage with our developer community while coordinating the MLOps World Meetup group events, fostering stronger connections and support within our network.

### Decoded

Created Decoded's initial data engineering platform on AWS, and developed four machine learning (ML) applications for language translation, churn prediction, fraud detection, and content recommendation. I led the creation of our MLOps engineering program (see it here) and contributed to our React-based presentation tool. I still teach for Decoded's biggest clients.

### Coder Academy

Data Scientist and Educator

At Coder Academy, I taught courses ranging from introduction to research to data analysis with Python, and with every course, I have been a student of my students as I always learn more from them than they do from me. My main responsibility though was to develop the first accredited Data Science Bootcamp outside of a university in Australia. Said bootcamp application for accreditation was submitted to TEQSA n July 2021.

Here are the subjects that I worked on for the past 2 years.

1. Programming for Data Analytics
2. Advanced Statistics
3. Data Engineering
4. Machine Learning
5. Cloud Computing, Data Ethics and Privacy
6. Software Engineering for Data Professionals (ML in Production)

I worked at LBS as an external instructor teaching a series of 6 sessions in statistical programming with Python for a course titled, People Analytics. Here is an overview of the topics I taught in all 6 sessions,

0. Intro to Python
1. Regression Pt 1
2. Regression Pt 2 
3. Panel Regression and Fixed Effects
4. Regularization 
5. Intro to NLP and Topic Modeling
6. Network Analysis

### INSEAD

Research Associate

During my tenure at INSEAD, I worked with a team of outstanding researchers on how to create an algorithm that generates the hierarchical structure of a company (e.g. vertical or horizontal) based on its historical job ads and those of similar companies.

Almost all approaches we explored involve, in one way or another, natural language processing and a stack of supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised machine learning methods.

I also worked on a Python package with an implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation that provides an automated way of searching for and selecting, the best topics from reviews given to a company (e.g. reviews given in glassdoor). In addition, the algorithm provides cultural measures based on the topics for each particular organization.
