## Abstract

Finding good datasets or web assets to build data products or websites with, respectively, 
can be time-consuming. For instance, data professionals might require data from heavily 
regulated industries like healthcare and finance, and, in contrast, software developers might 
want to skip the tedious task of collecting images, text, and videos for a website. Luckily, 
both scenarios can now benefit from the same solution, Synthetic Data.

Synthetic Data is artificially generated data created with machine learning models, algorithms, 
and simulations, and this workshop is designed to show you how to enter that synthetic world by 
teaching you how to create a full-stack tech product with five interrelated projects. These 
projects include reproducible data pipelines, a dashboard, machine learning models, a web 
interface, and a documentation site. So, if you want to enhance your data projects or find 
great assets to build a website with, come and spend 3 fun and knowledge-rich hours in this workshop.
