## Abstract

In this talk, we go over different machine learning monitoring techniques that 
can help us ensure our models continue to perform as expected after being deployed 
into production. We will discuss performance monitoring to track metrics like 
accuracy and latency over time, log analysis and telemetry data to debug errors, 
as well as explainability methods to identify and address predictions that deviate 
from our desired baseline.
